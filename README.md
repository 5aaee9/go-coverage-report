# Go coverage report

GitHub Action to add a coverage report and badge to your Go repo.

Apply it to your repo by adding this step your one of your workflows:

```yaml
    - name: Update coverage report
      uses: ncruces/go-coverage-report@main
```

Your repo needs to have a Wiki for the Action to work,
and workflows need to have read _and_ write permissions to the repo.

You should run this step _after_ your tests run (it will fail if tests fail),
and only for _one platform_ (don't do it in a matrix), _e.g._:

```yaml
    - name: Test
      run: go test -v ./...

    - if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
      name: Update coverage report
      uses: ncruces/go-coverage-report@main
```

This Action will generate an HTML report and SVG badge,
and save them as "hidden" files in your Wiki.

You can then apply them to your `README.md` with this Markdown snippet:

```markdown
[![Go Coverage](https://github.com/USER/REPO/wiki/coverage.svg)](https://raw.githack.com/wiki/USER/REPO/coverage.html)
```

## Use manually or as a pre-commit hook

The [script](coverage.sh) can also be run manually, or as a [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).
